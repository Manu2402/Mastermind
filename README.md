# Mastermind

Digital version of the classic board game “Mastermind”. 
Mastermind is a game in which a player must guess, through a series of attempts, a <b>secret code</b> composed of different colors. With each attempt, the “coder” will return clues to indicate to the player his or her progression through solving the secret code. Will you also be able to guess the secret code? Find out by trying “Mastermind”!

## Development
“Mastermind” was developed through the C# language and a graphics library, based on OpenGL, called “Aiv.Fast2D”.

## Screenshots
Below you will find a series of screenshots of the game. I recommend that you try it out to get the full experience.
