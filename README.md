# Mastermind

Digital version of the classic board game “Mastermind”. 
Mastermind is a game in which a player must guess, through a series of attempts, a <b>secret code</b> composed of different colors. With each attempt, the “coder” will return clues to indicate to the player his or her progression through solving the secret code. Will you also be able to guess the secret code? Find out by trying Mastermind!

## Development
Mastermind was developed through the C# language and a graphics library, based on OpenGL, called “Aiv.Fast2D”. <br>
This project was developed to test the skills acquired throughout the first year of the “Video Game Programming” course at AIV (Accademia Italiana dei Videogiochi)
